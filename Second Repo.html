    <h1>Programming</h1>
    <p>
        Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve
        problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create
        instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.
